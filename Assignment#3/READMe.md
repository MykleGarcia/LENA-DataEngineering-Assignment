For my assignment#3 kindly download all the files and put them into one folder.

All the import are already added in the code but just in case its required:
1. import pandas as pd
2. import random
3. import sqlite3

The file English_Names is a list of names for the code to generate proper names.
The SQL version I used is the one integrated with Spyder(Python 3.13) the SQLite3.

Just add the folder to an accessible Spyder path directory then run the Assignment#3.py

Thank you!
